This project was created for the course EECS1021 Object Oriented Programming from Senstors to Actuators at York University, Toronto, Canada. 

I used the firmata4j firmware with an arduino uno board, to control a capacitive moisture sensor and a pump in order to monitor the moisture level of a plant, and open a water valve
if the moisture level is too low. I also used the edu.princeton.cs.introcs.StdDraw package to create a moisture graph, so the moisture level can also be monitored by a user.

The project was intended to be used as an education and assemssent tool only.
